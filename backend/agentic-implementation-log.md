**Project:** Contract extraction agent using Google ADK + Vertex AI
**Started:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** In Progress - Step 1 Complete

---

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Step 1: GCP Setup & Environment (COMPLETE)

**Date:** 2025-10-01

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Google Cloud CLI verified (v526.0.1)
2. ✅ Authenticated with gcloud (`gcloud auth login`)
3. ✅ Set up Application Default Credentials (ADC)
4. ✅ Set project to `contract-reader-2-dev`
5. ✅ Updated quota project to match
6. ✅ Enabled Vertex AI API (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`)
7. ✅ Created `.env` file with GCP configuration
8. ✅ Installed `google-adk`, `anthropic[vertex]`, `python-dotenv`
9. ✅ Tested Vertex AI connection with Gemini 2.0 Flash - SUCCESS!

**Current Configuration:**
- **Project ID:** contract-reader-2-dev
- **Organization:** palace.cl (ID: 165254678508)
- **Location:** global (for Claude), us-central1 (for Gemini)
- **Model:** Gemini 2.0 Flash (temporary, switching to Claude once quota approved)
- **Billing:** Enabled ✓

**Blocked Items:**
- ⏳ Claude Sonnet 4.5 quota: Requested, awaiting Google approval
- Using Gemini 2.0 Flash as temporary replacement

**Files Created:**
- `backend/.env` - GCP configuration
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Updated with ADK dependencies
- `backend/gcp-setup.md` - Complete setup documentation
- `backend/agentic/test_vertex_gemini.py` - Gemini connection test (working)
- `backend/agentic/test_vertex_claude.py` - Claude test (quota pending)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Hello World ADK Agent (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Create a basic ADK agent with Gemini to verify the framework works

**Status:** Complete! Agent working in `adk web` UI

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Created proper folder structure: `agentic/contract_reader_agent/agent.py`
2. ✅ Built agent with two test tools: `greet_user()` and `calculate_sum()`
3. ✅ Fixed ADK discovery issues (needed `root_agent` variable, not `agent`)
4. ✅ Fixed location mismatch (.env had us-east5, needed us-central1 for Gemini)
5. ✅ Tested with `adk web` - agent responds correctly and uses tools!

**Key Learnings:**
- **ADK folder structure:** Must be `agentic/agent_name/agent.py`, not root-level files
- **Variable naming:** ADK specifically looks for `root_agent` variable in agent.py
- **Model location:** Gemini 2.0 Flash only in us-central1, not us-east5 or global
- **Location consistency:** Both `.env` GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION and vertexai.init() must match
- **Tool definition:** Simple Python functions with docstrings automatically become ADK tools

**Files Created:**
- `backend/agentic/contract_reader_agent/agent.py` - Main ADK agent (working!)
- `backend/agentic/test_agent_simple.py` - Direct Gemini test (bypassed ADK)
- `backend/agentic/test_agent_programmatic.py` - Tool usage test

**Configuration:**
```python
# agent.py uses:
model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
location="us-central1"  # Hardcoded for Gemini

# .env uses:
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1  # Must match!
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: File I/O Tools (COMPLETE)

**Date:** 2025-10-01

**Goal:** Create ADK tools for reading contracts and writing JSON outputs

**Status:** Complete! File I/O working with session-based approach

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Created `read_contract_file(contract_path)` tool
   - Loads contract into `_session_contract_text` global variable
   - Returns success message with character count
   - Avoids passing large text strings as parameters (prevents escaping issues)
2. ✅ Created `write_output_json(filename, json_data)` tool
   - Writes formatted JSON to `backend/output/` directory
   - Validates JSON before writing
   - Returns success message with file path
3. ✅ Updated agent instructions with clear workflow examples
4. ✅ Tested via `adk web` - both tools working perfectly!

**Key Learnings:**
- **Session-based approach:** Using global variables to pass data between tools avoids parameter escaping issues
- **Tool composability:** Separate tools maintain agentic flexibility while avoiding technical problems
- **Return messages:** Tools return success/error messages, not raw data (prevents malformed function calls)

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/agentic/contract_reader_agent/agent.py` - Added File I/O tools

**Testing:**
- ✅ Read contract from `prompts/contract.txt`
- ✅ Write test JSON to `output/test.json`

---

### ✅ Step 4: Core Values Extraction with Context Caching (COMPLETE)

**Date:** 2025-10-01

**Goal:** Integrate promptCoreValues.txt with Gemini context caching for cost savings

**Status:** Complete! Extraction working with 75% cost savings on cached tokens

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Added `google-genai>=1.0.0` to requirements.txt
2. ✅ Initialized Google GenAI client for Vertex AI context caching
3. ✅ Created `extract_core_values()` tool with:
   - Reads `promptCoreValues.txt` as system instruction
   - Creates context cache with contract text (5-minute TTL)
   - Uses cache for subsequent extractions (75% cheaper!)
   - Returns formatted JSON with extracted data
   - Auto-resets cache on expiry errors
4. ✅ Implemented session-based workflow:
   - `read_contract_file()` → loads into session
   - `extract_core_values()` → uses session contract
   - `write_output_json()` → saves extracted JSON
5. ✅ Added cache error handling with automatic reset
6. ✅ Tested end-to-end extraction successfully!

**Key Technical Details:**
- **Context caching:** Gemini 2.0 Flash caches contract text (saves 75% on cached tokens)
- **Cache TTL:** 300 seconds (5 minutes) - perfect for multi-prompt workflow
- **Minimum tokens:** 1,024 tokens required (our contracts are ~3.5K ✓)
- **Session variables:** `_session_contract_text` and `_contract_cache` persist between tool calls
- **Error handling:** Cache expiry triggers automatic reset for next run

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added google-genai
- `backend/agentic/contract_reader_agent/agent.py` - Added extraction tool

**Extraction Quality (First Test):**
- ✅ Dates extracted correctly (12/05/2020, 30/01/2024)
- ✅ Parties identified (NOSOTROS as counterparty)
- ✅ Legs properly structured (Pata-Activa, Pata-Pasiva)
- ✅ Notional amounts correct (CLP 14.3B, CLF 500K)
- ✅ Rate types correct (FLOATING with CLP-ICP, FIXED with -0.93%)
- ✅ Conditional fields handled properly (FIXED leg has `fixedRate`, no `floatingRateIndex`)
- ✅ Settlement type = CASH, currency = CLP
- ⚠️ Minor: Missing tradeId (should be "23615"), resetFrequency null

**Performance:**
- First extraction: ~30-40 seconds (creates cache + extraction)
- Subsequent extractions within 5 min: Expected 75% faster and cheaper (cache hit)
- Cache expires after 5 minutes, auto-resets on error

---

### ✅ Step 5: Business Day Conventions Extraction + Cache Reuse (COMPLETE)

**Date:** 2025-10-02

**Goal:** Add second extraction tool and demonstrate cache reuse across multiple extractions

**Status:** Complete! Cache reuse working, upgraded to Gemini 2.5 Pro for better quality

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Created `extract_business_day_conventions()` tool
   - Reads `promptHeaderBusinessDayConventions.txt`
   - Uses same session-based approach as core values
   - Reuses contract cache for 75% cost savings
2. ✅ Fixed critical cache architecture issue:
   - **Problem:** Cache was storing system instruction + contract together
   - **Solution:** Cache only contract text, pass system instruction per request
   - **Result:** Multiple extraction tools can share same cached contract with different prompts!
3. ✅ Fixed syntax errors in `parts=[` array closures (2 places)
4. ✅ Upgraded from Gemini 2.0 Flash → **Gemini 2.5 Pro**
   - Better extraction quality and reasoning
   - More accurate adherence to complex prompt rules
   - Same 75% caching discount applies
5. ✅ Tested end-to-end with both extractions - cache reuse working!

**Key Technical Learnings:**
- **Cache architecture:** Store immutable data (contract) in cache, pass variable data (prompts) per request
- **Cache key insight:** System instructions baked into cache prevent reuse with different prompts
- **Model selection matters:** Gemini 2.5 Pro significantly better at following detailed extraction rules
- **Cache reuse confirmed:** Second extraction shows "Attempting to reuse cache" in logs

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/agentic/contract_reader_agent/agent.py` - Added second extraction tool, fixed cache architecture

**Extraction Quality:**
- ✅ Both extractions now return correct, distinct data
- ✅ Core values: dates, parties, legs, notionals, rates
- ✅ Business day conventions: conventions + business centers for all dates
- ✅ Quality improved significantly with Gemini 2.5 Pro

**Performance:**
- First extraction: Creates cache (~30-40 seconds)
- Second extraction: Reuses cache (faster, 75% cheaper!)
- Cache persists 5 minutes for multi-prompt workflow

**Challenge Overcome:**
Initial implementation cached system instruction with contract, causing both extractions to return same data. Fixed by separating cached content (contract only) from per-request content (system instructions).

---

### ✅ Step 6: JSON Merger Tool (COMPLETE)

**Date:** 2025-10-02

**Goal:** Create tool to deep merge multiple JSON extraction results into unified output

**Status:** Complete! Merger working perfectly with nested objects and arrays

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Created `merge_json_extractions(json1_str, json2_str)` tool
   - Deep merge algorithm for nested dictionaries
   - Array merging by index (legs[0] + legs[0], legs[1] + legs[1])
   - Recursive merging for nested structures
   - Overlay strategy: later values overwrite earlier for duplicate keys
2. ✅ Updated agent instructions with merge workflow pattern
3. ✅ Added merger to tools list
4. ✅ Tested end-to-end: extract → extract → merge → save

**Key Technical Details:**
- **Deep merge algorithm:**
  - Dicts: Merge keys recursively, preserving nested structure
  - Lists: Merge by index, recursively merge dict elements
  - Primitives: Overlay wins (second value overwrites first)
- **Use case:** Combine Core Values + Business Day Conventions + future extractions
- **Result:** Single unified JSON with all contract data

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/agentic/contract_reader_agent/agent.py` - Added merger tool

**Merge Quality:**
- ✅ Header fields merged correctly (dates have both `.date` and `.businessDayConvention`)
- ✅ Leg arrays merged by index (preserves leg order)
- ✅ Nested structures preserved (no data loss)
- ✅ Clean, formatted output JSON

**Example Merged Structure:**
```json
{
  "header": {
    "tradeDate": {
      "date": "12/05/2020",
      "businessDayConvention": "MODFOLLOWING",
      "businessCenters": ["CLSA"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for all extracted data
- Easy to extend for additional extraction tools
- Maintains data integrity across multiple extractions
- Clean separation: extract → merge → save

---

### ✅ Step 7: Complete All 4 Extraction Tools (COMPLETE)

**Date:** 2025-10-02

**Goal:** Add remaining extraction tools and verify full pipeline with cache reuse

**Status:** Complete! All 4 extraction prompts working with cache reuse and merging

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Created `extract_period_payment_data()` tool
   - Reads `promptPeriodEndAndPaymentBusinessDayConventions.txt`
   - Extracts period end dates and payment dates conventions/frequencies
   - Reuses contract cache for 75% savings
2. ✅ Created `extract_fx_fixing()` tool
   - Reads `promptFXFixingData.txt`
   - Extracts FX fixing data for cross-currency swap legs
   - Reuses contract cache for 75% savings
3. ✅ Updated agent instructions documenting all 4 extraction tools
4. ✅ Added both tools to agent's tools list
5. ✅ Tested complete pipeline: all 4 extractions → merge → save
6. ✅ Verified cache reuse across all 4 tools

**Complete Tool Set (9 tools):**
- **File I/O (2):** read_contract_file, write_output_json
- **Extraction (4):** extract_core_values, extract_business_day_conventions, extract_period_payment_data, extract_fx_fixing
- **Merger (1):** merge_json_extractions
- **Test (2):** greet_user, calculate_sum

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/agentic/contract_reader_agent/agent.py` - Added 2 extraction tools

**Cache Reuse Performance:**
- Extraction 1 (Core Values): Creates cache (~30-40 seconds)
- Extraction 2 (Business Day): Reuses cache (faster, 75% cheaper!)
- Extraction 3 (Period/Payment): Reuses cache (faster, 75% cheaper!)
- Extraction 4 (FX Fixing): Reuses cache (faster, 75% cheaper!)
- **Total savings: 75% on 3 of 4 extractions!**

**Complete Pipeline Tested:**
```
Read Contract
  → Extract Core Values (creates cache)
  → Extract Business Day Conventions (reuses cache)
  → Extract Period/Payment Data (reuses cache)
  → Extract FX Fixing (reuses cache)
  → Merge all 4 JSONs
  → Save unified contract
```

**Merged Output Quality:**
- ✅ All 4 extraction results combined into single JSON
- ✅ No data loss in merge process
- ✅ Nested structures preserved correctly
- ✅ Leg arrays merged by index
- ✅ Complete contract representation in one file

**Achievement:**
**MVP COMPLETE!** Full agentic contract extraction pipeline working end-to-end with cost optimization through context caching.
