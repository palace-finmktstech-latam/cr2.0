# Bank field:
legs[0].leg_generator.rp
# Example content:
Enum: A or P
# Target field:
legs[0].payerPartyReference
legs[0].receiverPartyReference
or
legs[1].payerPartyReference
legs[1].receiverPartyReference
# Instructions:
This is a key and very important field. It indicates whether this leg (indicated by the index [n]) is the leg that the bank receives (will have a value of A) or pays (will have a value of P). In the target structure, the legs[0] object is ALWAYS the leg that the bank receives (and the counterparty pays), the target legs[0].payerPartyReference value will always be OurCounterparty and legs[0].receiverPartyReference will always be ThisBank. In the same vein, the legs[1] object is ALWAYS the leg that the counterparty receives (and the bank pays), so the target legs[1].payerPartyReference value will always be ThisBank and legs[1].receiverPartyReference will always be OurCounterparty. It is important to consider that the legs[0].leg_generator.rp will not actually populate legs[0].payerPartyReference, legs[0].receiverPartyReference, legs[1].payerPartyReference or legs[1].receiverPartyReference, as these will be hardcoded in the output. It will however, allow the program to determine which leg refers to the paying or receiving leg.

# Instructions:
In the target fields, these values are expressed as an array of strings indicating all applicable business centers. Therefore NY should translate as ["USNY"], SCL should translate as ["CLSA"], LON should translate as ["GBLO"]. And those calendars made of two or more should translate as follows: NY-SCL should translate as ["USNY","CLSA"], LON-SCL should translate as ["GBLO","CLSA"], NY-LON-SCL should translate as ["USNY","GBLO","CLSA"], etc.

# Target field:
legs[0].calculationPeriodFrequency or legs[1].calculationPeriodFrequency (depending on whether this is pay or receive for the bank)
# Instructions:
This is a complicated set of fields, which is used in conjunction to determine the frequency of the calculationPeriod. If, for example the input values are 0,9,0 for these three fields, the calculationPeriodFrequency would be 9 months, although I'm not yet sure how to express that in the output JSON.
If the period expressed in the input values is longer than the period between legs[0].leg_generator.start_date.fecha and legs[0].leg_generator.end_date.fecha (e.g. 25,0,0) then this indicates a zero coupon leg and therefore the calculationPeriodFrequency would be set as TERM.

# Target field:
legs[0].paymentFrequency or legs[1].paymentFrequency (depending on whether this is pay or receive for the bank)
# Instructions:
This is a complicated set of fields, which is used in conjunction to determine the frequency of the paymentFrequency. If, for example the input values are 0,6,0 for these three fields, the paymentFrequency would be 6 months, although I'm not yet sure how to express that in the output JSON.
If the period expressed in the input values is longer than the period between legs[0].leg_generator.start_date.fecha and legs[0].leg_generator.end_date.fecha (e.g. 25,0,0) then this indicates a zero coupon leg and therefore the paymentFrequency would be set as ATMATURITY.

legs[0].calculationPeriodFrequency or legs[1].calculationPeriodFrequency (depending on whether this is pay or receive for the bank)
# Instructions:
This is a complicated set of fields, which is used in conjunction to determine the frequency of the calculationPeriod. If, for example the input values are 0,9,0 for these three fields, the calculationPeriodFrequency would be 9 months, although I'm not yet sure how to express that in the output JSON.
If the period expressed in the input values is longer than the period between legs[1].leg_generator.start_date.fecha and legs[1].leg_generator.end_date.fecha (e.g. 25,0,0) then this indicates a zero coupon leg and therefore the calculationPeriodFrequency would be set as TERM.
# Mandatory input field:
Yes, although 0 is a valid value

# Bank field:
legs[1].leg_generator.settlement_periodicity.agnos
legs[1].leg_generator.settlement_periodicity.meses
legs[1].leg_generator.settlement_periodicity.dias
# Example content:

0
# Target field:
legs[0].paymentFrequency or legs[1].paymentFrequency (depending on whether this is pay or receive for the bank)
# Instructions:
This is a complicated set of fields, which is used in conjunction to determine the frequency of the paymentFrequency. If, for example the input values are 0,6,0 for these three fields, the paymentFrequency would be 6 months, although I'm not yet sure how to express that in the output JSON.
If the period expressed in the input values is longer than the period between legs[1].leg_generator.start_date.fecha and legs[1].leg_generator.end_date.fecha (e.g. 25,0,0) then this indicates a zero coupon leg and therefore the paymentFrequency would be set as ATMATURITY.

# Instructions:
Translate legs[n].multi_currency.fx_fixing_lag 1 to -2 in the target file (legs[n].fxFixing.fxFixingOffset). I need to view more examples of this to determine the correct behaviour, but for the time being do this.
Set legs[n].fxFixing.fxFixingDayConvention to PRECEDING in the target file. Set legs[b].fxFixing.fxFixingBusinessCenters to the same calendars as are set in legs[n].calculationBusinessCenters

Only applies to legs which have legs[n].rateType = FLOATING. The equivalent target field on a fixed leg would be legs[n].coupon_rate_value

# Bank field:
legs[1].leg_generator.fix_adj_rule
# Example content:
Enum: DONT_MOVE, FOLLOW, MOD_FOLLOW (others that I don't know yet)
# Target field:
legs[0].resetDayConvention or legs[0].resetDayConvention (depending on whether this is pay or receive for the bank)
# Instructions:
MOD_FOLLOW should be translated to MODFOLLOWING
FOLLOW should be translated to FOLLOWING
DONT_MOVE should be translated to NONE
I don't yet know the other input enums, will complement the list later

# Bank field:
legs[1].leg_generator.fixing_calendar

# Target field:
legs[0].resetBusinessCenters or legs[1].resetBusinessCenters (depending on whether this is pay or receive for the bank)
# Instructions:
In the target fields, these values are expressed as an array of strings indicating all applicable business centers. Therefore NY should translate as ["USNY"], SCL should translate as ["CLSA"], LON should translate as ["GBLO"]. And those calendars made of two or more should translate as follows: NY-SCL should translate as ["USNY","CLSA"], LON-SCL should translate as ["GBLO","CLSA"], NY-LON-SCL should translate as ["USNY","GBLO","CLSA"], etc.
