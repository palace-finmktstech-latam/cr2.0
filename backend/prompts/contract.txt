Valuation Postponement for

Disruption,  would  have  been  the  Valuation  Date)  for  a  consecutive

next applicable Disruption Fallback.

day following such period, then such day shall be deemed to be a
Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse of any such 14 day period,
a Price Source Disruption shall have occurred or be continuing on the
day following such period, then Valuation Postponement shall not
apply and the Spot Rate shall be determined in accordance with the
next Disruption Fallback.
Maximum Days of Postponement:Fourteen (14)calendar days
No Adjustments to Period
End Dates or the Termination
Date:For the avoidance of any doubt, any adjustment to, or deferral of, (A)
the  date  on  which  a  Spot  Rate  is  determined,  (B)  any  Payment  Date
or (C) any Exchange Date pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof
shall not adjust or otherwise affect the occurrence of any Period End
Date (including the Termination Date) for the purposes of determining
any Calculation Period.
Payment Date and
Exchange Date Adjustments:If a Valuation Date is adjusted due to the occurrence of an Unscheduled
Holiday or on account of a Disruption Event, then the related Payment
Date or Exchange Date shall be as soon as practicable after the relevant
Valuation Date, but in no event later than the day which is two Business
Days following the date on which the Spot Rate is determined.
Further,  if  payments  are  scheduled  to  be  made  by  both  parties  on  a
Payment Date or an Exchange Date, if any, and such date is adjusted
due to the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday or on account of a
Disruption Event, then such Payment Date shall be adjusted in respect
of both parties’ payment obligations.
