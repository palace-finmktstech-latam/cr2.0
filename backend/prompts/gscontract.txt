In  the  event  the  Scheduled  Valuation  Date 
becomes  subject  to  the  Following  Business 
Day  Convention  after  the  occurrence  of  an 
Unscheduled  Holiday,  and  if  the  Valuation 
Date has not occurred on or before the 14th 
consecutive     day     after     the     Scheduled 
Valuation  Date  (any  such  period  being  a

Business   Day   first   succeeding   the   day   on 
which  the  Price  Source  Disruption  ceases  to 
exist,   unless   the   Price   Source   Disruption 
continues  to  exist  (measured  from  the  date

Disruption,   would  have   been   the   Valuation 
Date)  for  a  consecutive  number  of  calendar 
days    equal    to    the    Maximum    Days    of 
Postponement.  In  such  event,  the  Spot Rate 
will  be  determined  on  the  next  Business  Day 
after  the  Maximum  Days  of  Postponement  in 
accordance with the next applicable Disruption 
Fallback. 
Cumulative Events: Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein  to 
the contrary, in no event shall the total number

combination  of  (i)  or  (ii)  above  has  occurred, 
shall    exceed    14    (fourteen)    consecutive 
calendar days in total. Accordingly, if upon the 
lapse of any such 14 (fourteen) day period, an 
Unscheduled  Holiday  shall  have  occurred  or 
be  continuing  on  that  day  that  follows  such 
period, then such day shall be deemed to be a 
Valuation Date  and,  if  upon  the  lapse  of  any 
such  14  (fourteen)  day  period,  a  Price  Source 
Disruption has occurred or is continuing on the 

7 of 22 
day    that    follows    such    period,    then    the 
Valuation  Postponement  shall  not  apply  and 
the  Spot  Rate  shall  thereby  be  determined  in 
accordance with the Disruption Fallback that is 
next deemed applicable to this Transaction. 
Maximum Days of Postponement: "Maximum    Days    of    Postponement"    shall 
mean,   for   purposes    of    this   Transaction, 
fourteen (14) calendar days

the Following Business Day Convention in the 
event of an Unscheduled Holiday. 
Applicable  to  the  CLF  Observation 
Date: 
That which  is  applicable  to  all  Fixed Amount 
Payer  Payment  Dates;  provided  however,  that

Date: 
If the Valuation Date in respect of a Reference 
Currency     Payment     Date,     a     Reference 
Currency  Exchange  Date  or  the  Termination 
Date  is  not  the  Scheduled  Valuation  Date  in 
respect  of  such  Reference  Currency  Payment 
Date,  Reference  Currency  Exchange  Date  or 
Termination    Date,    then    such    Reference 
Currency  Payment  Date,  Reference  Currency 
Exchange   Date   or   Termination   Date   (as 
applicable)  shall  be  as  soon  as  practicable 
after  the  relevant  Valuation  Date,  but  in  no 
event later than the day which is two Business 
Days    after    the    relevant    Valuation    Date. 
Further,   if   payments   are   scheduled   to   be  
made  by  both  parties  on  a  Payment  Date, 
Exchange Date or Termination Date, and such 
date  is  adjusted  due  to  the  occurrence  of  an 
Unscheduled  Holiday  in  accordance  with  the 
previous  sentence,  then  such  Payment  Date,

shall not apply in respect of Period End Dates
