------------------------------------------------------------

‚úó STRONG_DISAGREE (confidence: 5)
  Field: legs[1].terminationDate.businessDayConvention
  Extracted Value: FOLLOWING
  Claude's Suggested Value: MODFOLLOWING
  Gemini Confidence: low ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è [BOTH MODELS UNCERTAIN]
  Evidence: No explicit business day convention found in contract for Leg 1 Termination Date. Gemini defaulted to FOLLOWING (Clear=false).
  Reasoning: When no explicit business day convention is found, the default MUST be MODFOLLOWING (industry standard), not FOLLOWING. Since Gemini set Clear=false, this indicates it used a default value, which should have been MODFOLLOWING.

  Field: header.tradeDate.businessDayConvention
  Extracted Value: MODFOLLOWING
  Gemini Confidence: low ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è [BOTH MODELS UNCERTAIN]
  Evidence: No explicit business day convention specified for trade date in contract. Only general reference to 'Convenci√≥n de d√≠as H√°biles que se aplicar√° en el caso que la Fecha de Fijaci√≥n, de Pago o Vencimiento recayere en un d√≠a inh√°bil.'
  Reasoning: Contract does not specify business day convention for trade date. MODFOLLOWING is a reasonable default assumption but cannot be confirmed from contract text.

‚úó STRONG_DISAGREE (confidence: 5)
  Field: legs[0].settlementType
  Extracted Value: PHYSICAL
  Claude's Suggested Value: CASH
  Gemini Confidence: high
  Evidence: Modalidad de Pago: Compensado CLP - Both legs settle in CLP currency as indicated by the compensation mechanism
  Reasoning: According to instructions, settlement type is determined by comparing settlement currencies across legs. Both legs settle in CLP (leg 0 CLF converts to CLP, leg 1 is CLP), so same settlement currency means CASH settlement for both legs.
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED

‚úó STRONG_DISAGREE (confidence: 5)
  Field: legs[0].settlementCurrency
  Extracted Value: CLF
  Claude's Suggested Value: CLP
  Gemini Confidence: high
  Evidence: Modalidad de Pago: Compensado CLP and section IV states obligations will be fulfilled under 'modalidad de Compensado' with amounts converted to 'Moneda Nacional' (CLP)
  Reasoning: Contract clearly states compensation in CLP. The CLF notional is converted to CLP for settlement purposes, making CLP the settlement currency.

  Extracted Value: Leg 0: No fxFixing, Leg 1: Has fxFixing
  Claude's Suggested Value: Leg 0: Should have fxFixing, Leg 1: Should not have fxFixing
  Gemini Confidence: N/A
  Evidence: Paridad de Referencia: Unidad de Fomento publicada en la p√°gina del Banco Central de Chile, seg√∫n fecha de t√©rmino - This UF reference applies to converting CLF to CLP
