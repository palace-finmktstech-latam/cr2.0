in    the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions.

Settlement Rate Option: CLP Dollar OBS (as defined below) 
Reference Currency: CLP 
Settlement Currency: USD 
Settlement Date: Each Payment Date or Exchange Date, provided however, that if   Valuation 
Postponement applies the Settlement Date shall be as soon as practical, but in no event 
later than, two Business Days after the date on which the Settlement Rate is    determined. 
Further, if   payments are scheduled to be made by both parties on a   Settlement Date, and 
such date is    adjusted due to the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday, then such 
Settlement Date shall be adjusted in respect of both parties' payments. 
Valuation Date: In respect of any Settlement Date, the date which is    2  Business Day(s) prior 
to that Settlement Date (each, a "Scheduled Valuation Date"); provided however that in the 
event of an Unscheduled Holiday, the Valuation Date shall be subject to adjustment in 
accordance with the Following Business Day Convention. 
In the event the Scheduled Valuation Date becomes subject to the Following Business Day 
Convention after the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday, and if   the Valuation Date has 
not occurred on or before the 14th consecutive day after the Scheduled Valuation Date (any 
such period being a   "Deferral Period"), then the next day after the Deferral Period that 
would have been a   Business Day but for the Unscheduled Holiday, shall be deemed to be the 
Valuation Date.

9/21Deal No: 68923026, Deal Alias: 
CE3G27329544, ID: 
1006264477(1-1)
FALLBACKS: 
(1) Valuation Postponement 
(2) Calculation Agent Determination of Settlement Rate 
Adjustment to Termination Date, Payment Dates and Exchange Dates: If the Valuation Date 
in respect of a Payment Date, an Exchange Date or the Termination Date is    not the 
Scheduled Valuation Date in respect of such Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination 
Date or if   Valuation Postponement applies, then such Payment Date, Exchange Date or 
Termination Date (as applicable) shall be as soon as practicable after the relevant Spot Rate 
is determined, but in no event later than the day which is    two Business Days after the 
relevant Spot Rate is    determined. Further, if   payments are scheduled to be made by both 
parties on a   Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination Date, and such date is    adjusted 
due to the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday or Valuation Postponement in accordance 
with the previous sentence, then such Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination Date 
shall be adjusted in respect of both parties' payments. For the avoidance of doubt, such 
adjustments shall not apply in respect of Period End Dates (including the Termination Date) 
for the purpose of determining the Calculation Periods. 
Additional Definitions: 
"CLP" means the lawful currency of the Republic of Chile. CLP will be deemed to include any 
lawful successor currency (the "Successor Currency") of the Republic of Chile. If, after the 
Trade Date and on or before the Termination Date, the Republic of Chile has lawfully 
eliminated, converted, redenominated or exchanged its currency in effect on such Trade 
Date or any Successor Currency, as the case may be (the "Original Currency"), for a 
Successor Currency, then for purposes of calculating any amounts of such currency pursuant 
to this Transaction, and for purposes of effecting settlement hereof, any Original Currency 
amounts will be converted to the Successor Currency by multiplying the amount of Original 
Currency by a   ratio of Successor Currency to Original Currency, which ratio will be calculated 
on the basis of the exchange rate set forth by the Republic of Chile for converting the 
Original Currency into the Successor Currency on the date on which the elimination, 
conversion, redenomination or exchange took place. If   there is    more than one such date, the 
date closest to the relevant Payment Date will be selected. 
"CLP Dollar OBS Rate" in respect of any Valuation Date shall mean Chilean Peso/U.S. Dollar 
"observado" rate, expressed as the amount of Chilean Pesos per one U.S. Dollar, for 
settlement in one Business Day reported by the Banco Central de Chile (www.bcentral.cl) as 
the "Dólar Observado" (Dollar Observado) rate by not later than 10:30 a.m., Santiago time, 
on the first Business Day following that Valuation Date. 
"Maximum Days of Postponement" means Fourteen (14) calendar days 

10/21Deal No: 68923026, Deal Alias: 
CE3G27329544, ID: 
1006264477(1-1)
"Unscheduled Holiday" shall mean, for the purpose of this Transaction, that a day is    not a 
Business Day and the market was not aware of such fact (by means of public announcement 
or by reference to other publicly available information) until a   time later than 9:00 a.m. local 
time in Santiago, two Business Days prior to the Valuation Date. 
"Valuation Postponement" means, for purposes of obtaining a   Settlement Rate, that the 
Spot Rate will be determined on the Business Day first succeeding the day on which the Price 
Source Disruption ceases to exist, unless the Price Source Disruption continues to exist 
(measured from the date, that, but for the occurrence of the Price Source Disruption, would 
have been the Valuation Date) for a consecutive number of calendar days equal to the 
Maximum Days of Postponement. In such event, the Spot Rate will be determined on the 
next Business Day after the Maximum Days of Postponement in accordance with the next 
applicable Disruption Fallback. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the total number of 
consecutive calendar days during which either (i) valuation is    deferred due to an 
Unscheduled Holiday, or (ii) a   Valuation Postponement shall occur (or any combination of (i) 
and (ii)), exceed 14 consecutive calendar days in the aggregate. Accordingly, (x) if, upon the 
lapse of any such 14 day period, an Unscheduled Holiday shall have occurred or be 
continuing on the day following such period, then such day shall be deemed to be a 
Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse of any such 14 day period, a   Price Source 
Disruption shall have occurred or be continuing on the day following such period, then 
Valuation Postponement shall not apply and the Settlement Rate shall be determined in 
accordance with the next Disruption Fallback. 
Relevant Cities for Business Day(s)
