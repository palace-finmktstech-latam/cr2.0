Further, if   payments are scheduled to be made by both parties on a   Settlement Date, and 
such date is    adjusted due to the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday, then such 
Settlement Date shall be adjusted in respect of both parties' payments. 
Valuation Date: In respect of any Settlement Date, the date which is    2  Business Day(s) prior 
to that Settlement Date (each, a "Scheduled Valuation Date"); provided however that in the 
event of an Unscheduled Holiday, the Valuation Date shall be subject to adjustment in

CE3G23487232, ID: 
34953631(1-4)
Convention after the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday, and if the Valuation Date has 
not occurred on or before the 30th consecutive day after the Scheduled Valuation Date (any

would have been a Business Day but for the Unscheduled Holiday, shall be deemed to be the 
Valuation Date. 
DISRUPTION EVENT AND FALLBACK:

FALLBACKS: 
(1) Valuation Postponement
(2) Calculation Agent Determination of Settlement Rate
Adjustment to Termination Date, Payment Dates and Exchange Dates: If the Valuation Date

Scheduled Valuation Date in respect of such Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination 
Date or if Valuation Postponement applies, then such Payment Date, Exchange Date or 
Termination Date (as applicable) shall be as soon as practicable after the relevant Spot Rate 
is determined, but in no event later than the day which is two Business Days after the 
relevant Spot Rate is determined. Further, if payments are scheduled to be made by both 
parties on a Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination Date, and such date is adjusted 
due to the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday or Valuation Postponement in accordance 
with the previous sentence, then such Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination Date 
shall be adjusted in respect of both parties' payments. For the avoidance of doubt, such 
adjustments shall not apply in respect of Period End Dates (including the Termination Date) 
for the purpose of determining the Calculation Periods. 
Additional Definitions: 
"CLP" means the lawful currency of the Republic of Chile. CLP will be deemed to include any 
lawful successor currency (the "Successor Currency") of the Republic of Chile. If, after the

eliminated, converted, redenominated or exchanged its currency in effect on such Trade 
Date or any Successor Currency, as the case may be (the "Original Currency"), for a 
Successor Currency, then for purposes of calculating any amounts of such currency pursuant 
to this Transaction, and for purposes of effecting settlement hereof, any Original Currency 
amounts will be converted to the Successor Currency by multiplying the amount of Original 
Currency by a ratio of Successor Currency to Original Currency, which ratio will be calculated 
on the basis of the exchange rate set forth by the Republic of Chile for converting the 
Original Currency into the Successor Currency on the date on which the elimination, 
conversion, redenomination or exchange took place. If there is more than one such date, the 
date closest to the relevant Payment Date will be selected.

the "Dólar Observado" (Dollar Observado) rate by not later than 10:30 a.m., Santiago time, 
on the first Business Day following that Valuation Date.

CBF as published in the Diario Oficial de la Republica de Chile (the "ICP Rules") and which is 
reported on the CBF website by not later than 8:00 p.m.,Santiago time, on that Reset Date. 
If, in respect of any Reset Date, the rate fails to appear by 8:00 p.m., Santiago time, then the

Calculation Agent in respect to each Calculation Period as follows:

Where: 
'CL-ICP-CBF
0
' means, with respect to such Calculation Period, CL-ICP-CBF determined as if the 
first day of such Calculation Period (or the Effective Date in respect of the initial Calculation 
Period) were the Reset Date. 
'CL-ICP-CBF

Period End Date of such Calculation Period (or the Termination Date in respect of the final 
Calculation Period) were the Reset Date. 
'N' means, with respect to such Calculation Period, the number of calendar days in such 
Calculation Period. 
The TNA for a Calculation Period shall be determined on the Period End Date of such 
Calculation Period and shall be (a) expressed as a   percentage, (b) calculated to four decimal 
points, and (c) rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of a   percent. 
"Unscheduled Holiday" shall mean, for the purpose of this Transaction, that a day is    not a 
Business Day and the market was not aware of such fact (by means of public announcement 
or by reference to other publicly available information) until a   time later than 9:00 a.m. local 
time in Santiago, two Business Days prior to the Valuation Date. 
"Valuation Postponement" means, for purposes of obtaining a   Settlement Rate, that the 
Spot Rate will be determined on the Business Day first succeeding the day on which the Price

next Business Day after the Maximum Days of Postponement in accordance with the next 
applicable Disruption Fallback.

consecutive calendar days during which either (i) valuation is deferred due to an 
Unscheduled Holiday, or (ii) a Valuation Postponement shall occur (or any combination of (i) 
and (ii)), exceed 30 consecutive calendar days in the aggregate. Accordingly, (x) if, upon the 
lapse of any such 30 day period, an Unscheduled Holiday shall have occurred or be 
continuing on the day following such period, then such day shall be deemed to be a 
Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse of any such 30 day period, a Price Source 
Disruption shall have occurred or be continuing on the day following such period, then 
Valuation Postponement shall not apply and the Settlement Rate shall be determined in 
accordance with the next Disruption Fallback.
