Other Terms:
 
Definition of "Unscheduled Holiday":
 
"Unscheduled Holiday" means that a day is not a Business
Day  and  the  market  was  not  aware  of  such  fact  (by
means of a public announcement or by reference to other
publicly  available  information)  until  a  time  later  than
9:00 am local time in the Principal Financial Center(s) of
the  Reference  Currency  two  Business  Days  prior  to  the
Scheduled Valuation Date
Deferral Period for Unscheduled Holiday:
 
In  the  event  the  Scheduled  Valuation  Date  becomes
subject  to  the  Following  Business  Day  Convention  after
the  occurrence  of  an  Unscheduled  Holiday,  and  if  the
Valuation  Date  has  not  occurred  on  or  before  the  14th
consecutive day after the Scheduled Valuation Date (any
such period being a "Deferral Period"), then the next day
after the Deferral Period that would have been a Business

Source Disruption, would have been the Valuation Date)
for  a  consecutive  number  of  calendar  days  equal  to  the
Maximum Days of Postponement. In such event, the Spot
Rate will be determined on the next Business Day after the
Maximum Days of Postponement in accordance with the
next applicable Disruption Fallback.
 
Cumulative Events:
 
Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the  contrary,  in  no
event shall the total number of consecutive calendar days
during  which  either  (i)  valuation  is  deferred  due  to  an
Unscheduled  Holiday,  or  (ii)  a  Valuation  Postponement
shall occur (or any combination of (i) and (ii)), exceed 14
consecutive calendar days in the aggregate. Accordingly,
(x)  if,  upon  the  lapse  of  any  such  14-day  period,  an
Unscheduled Holiday shall have occurred or be continuing
on the day following such period, then such days shall be
deemed to be a Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse
of any such 14 day period, a Price Source Disruption shall
have occurred or be continuing on the day following such
period, then Valuation Postponement shall not apply and
the Spot Rate shall be determined in accordance with the
next Disruption Fallback.
 
Maximum Days of Postponement:
 
Fourteen (14) calendar days
 
Adjustment to Termination Date, Payment Dates and
Exchange Dates:
 
If payments are scheduled to be made by both parties
on a Payment Date and such date is adjusted due to the
occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday or the application
of Valuation Postponement, then such Payment Date
shall be adjusted in respect of both parties payment
obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, such adjustments
shall not apply in respect of a Period End Date (including
the Termination Date) for the purposes of determining
the Calculation Periods. Further, if the Valuation Date in
respect of a Payment Date is not the Scheduled Valuation
Date in respect of such Payment Date or if Valuation
Postponement applies, then such Payment Date shall
be as soon as practicable after the relevant Spot Rate
is determined, but in no event later than the day which
is two Business Days after the relevant Spot Rate is
determined.
