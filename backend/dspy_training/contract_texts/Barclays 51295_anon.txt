Valuation Postponement for Price Source Disruption:“Valuation   Postponement”   means,   for   purposes   of
obtaining a Settlement Rate, that the Spot Rate will be
determined on the Business Day first succeeding the day
on  which  the  Price  Source  Disruption  ceases  to  exist,
unless  the  Price  Source  Disruption  continues  to  exist
(measured  from  the  date  that,  but  for  the  occurrence
of  the  Price  Source  Disruption,  would  have  been  the
Valuation  Date)  for  a  consecutive  number  of  calendar
days  equal  to  the  Maximum  Days  of  Postponement.
In  such  event,  the  Spot  Rate  will  be  determined  on
the  next  Business  Day  after  the  Maximum  Days  of
Postponement  in  accordance  with  the  next  applicable
Disruption Fallback.

event  shall  the  total  number  of  consecutive  calendar

Postponement  shall  occur  (or  any  combination  of  (i)
and  (ii)),  exceed  14  consecutive  calendar  days  in  the
aggregate.  Accordingly,  (x)  if,  upon  the  lapse  of  any
such  14  day  period,  an  Unscheduled  Holiday  shall
have  occurred  or  be  continuing  on  the  day  following
such  period,  then  such  day  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the
Valuation  Date,  and  (y)  if,  upon  the  lapse  of  any  such
14  day  period,  a  Price  Source  Disruption  shall  have
occurred  or  be  continuing  on  the  day  following  such
period, then Valuation Postponement shall not apply and

made by both parties on a Payment Date, and such date
is  adjusted  due  to  the  occurrence  of  an  Unscheduled

then such Payment Date shall be adjusted in respect of
both parties’ payment obligations. For the avoidance of
doubt,  such  adjustments  shall  not  apply  in  respect  of
