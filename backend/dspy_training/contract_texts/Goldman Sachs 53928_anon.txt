Unscheduled Holiday: "Unscheduled  Holiday"  shall  mean,  for  the 
purpose of this Transaction, that a day is not 
a  Business  Day  and  the  market  was  not 
aware  of  such  fact  (by  means of  a  public 
announcement   or   by   reference   to   other 
publicly  available  information)  until  a  time 
later  than  9:00  am  local  time  in  the  Principal 
Financial     Center(s)     of     the     Reference 
Currency  two  Business  Days  prior  to  the 
Scheduled    Valuation    Date;    where    the 
definition  of  Business Day  in  Article  1.1(b)  of 
the   1998   FX   Definitions   is   expanded   to 
include the definition of UF Observation Date. 
Deferral    Period    for    Unscheduled 
Holiday: 
In  the  event  the  Scheduled  Valuation  Date 
becomes  subject  to  the  Following  Business 
Day  Convention  after  the  occurrence  of  an 
Unscheduled  Holiday,  and  if  the  Valuation 

 
6 of 26 
Date  has  not  occurred  on  or  before  the 14th 
consecutive     day     after     the     Scheduled 
Valuation  Date  (any  such  period  being  a 
"Deferral Period"), then the next day after the 
Deferral   Period   that   would   have   been   a 
Business   Day   but   for   the   Unscheduled 
Holiday, shall be deemed to be the Valuation 
Date. 
 
Valuation   Postponement   for   Price 
Source Disruption: 
"Valuation Postponement" means, for 
purposes of obtaining a Settlement Rate, that 
the  Spot  Rate  will  be  determined  on  the 
Business  Day  first  succeeding  the  day  on 
which  the  Price  Source  Disruption  ceases  to 
exist,   unless   the   Price   Source   Disruption 
continues  to  exist  (measured  from  the  date 
that,  but  for   the   occurrence   of   the   Price 
Source   Disruption,   would   have   been   the 
Valuation  Date)  for  a  consecutive  number  of 
calendar days equal to the Maximum Days of 
Postponement.  In  such  event,  the  Spot  Rate 
will be determined on the next Business Day 
after the Maximum Days of Postponement in 
accordance     with     the     next     applicable 
Disruption Fallback. 
 
Cumulative Events: Notwithstanding anything contained herein to 
the   contrary,   in   no   event   shall   the   total 
number  of consecutive  calendar  days  during 
which  either  (i)  the  valuation  is  deferred  due 
to the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday, 
or  (ii)  a  Valuation  Postponement  shall  occur, 
or  any  combination  of  (i)  or  (ii)  above  has 
occurred,     shall     exceed     14     (fourteen) 
consecutive calendar days in total. 
Accordingly, if upon the lapse of any such 14 
(fourteen)    day    period,    an    Unscheduled 
Holiday  shall  have  occurred  or  be  continuing 
on  that  day  that  follows  such  period,  then 
such  day  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  Valuation 
Date  and,  if  upon  the  lapse  of  any  such  14 
(fourteen)    day    period,    a    Price    Source 
Disruption  has  occurred  or  is  continuing  on 
the  day  that  follows  such  period,  then  the 
Valuation  Postponement  shall  not  apply  and 
the Spot Rate shall thereby be determined in 

7 of 26 
accordance  with  the  Disruption  Fallback  that 
is next deemed applicable to this 
Transaction. 
Maximum Days of Postponement: "Maximum   Days   of   Postponement"   shall 
mean,   for   purposes   of   this   Transaction, 
fourteen (14) calendar days 
Business Day Convention: 
Applicable to the Scheduled 
Valuation Date: 
Preceding;    provided,    however,    that    the 
adjustment shall be made in accordance with 
the  Following  Business  Day  Convention  in 
the event of an Unscheduled Holiday. 
Applicable  to  the  CLF  Observation 
Date: 
That  which  is  applicable  to  all  Fixed Amount 
Payer   Payment   Dates;   provided   however, 
that no adjustment shall be made in the event 
of an Unscheduled Holiday. 
Adjustment     to     Payment     Dates, 
Exchange   Dates   and   Termination 
Date: 
If   the   Valuation   Date   in   respect   of   a 
Reference    Currency    Payment    Date,    a 
Reference  Currency  Exchange  Date  or  the 
Termination   Date   is   not   the   Scheduled 
Valuation  Date  in  respect  of  such  Reference 
Currency Payment Date, Reference Currency 
Exchange  Date  or  Termination  Date,  then 
such   Reference   Currency   Payment   Date, 
Reference    Currency    Exchange    Date    or 
Termination  Date  (as  applicable)  shall  be  as 
soon    as    practicable    after    the    relevant 
Valuation Date, but in no event later than the 
day  which  is two Business  Days  after  the 
relevant Valuation Date. Further, if payments 
are scheduled to be  made by both parties on 
a    Payment    Date,    Exchange    Date    or 
Termination  Date,  and  such  date  is  adjusted 
due  to  the  occurrence  of  an  Unscheduled 
Holiday   in   accordance   with   the   previous 
sentence,     then     such     Payment     Date, 
Exchange  Date  or Termination  Date  shall  be 
adjusted in respect of both parties’ payments. 
For the avoidance of doubt, such adjustments 
shall not apply in respect of Period End Dates 
(including   the   Termination   Date)   for   the 

8 of 26 
purposes   of   determining   the   Calculation 
Periods.

action which legally or de facto prevents or has the effect of restricting or limiting the 
calculation or publication of UF or any of the values used to determine UF; 
"CLF Observation Date" means, each Payment Date or the Final Exchange Date, as 
applicable; provided, however, that such date shall not be adjusted on account of an
