Adjustment to Termination Date, Payment Dates and Exchange Dates: If the Valuation Date in 
respect of a Payment Date, an Exchange Date or the Termination Date is    not the Scheduled 
Valuation Date in respect of such Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination Date or if 
Valuation Postponement applies, then such Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination Date 
(as applicable) shall be as soon as practicable after the relevant Spot Rate is    determined, but in

Exchange Date or Termination Date, and such date is    adjusted due to the occurrence of an

Additional Definitions: 
"CLP" means the lawful currency of the Republic of Chile. CLP will be deemed to include 
any lawful successor currency (the "Successor Currency") of the Republic of Chile. If, 
after the Trade Date and on or before the Termination Date, the Republic of Chile has 
lawfully eliminated, converted, redenominated or exchanged its currency in effect on 
such Trade Date or any Successor Currency, as the case may be (the "Original 
Currency"), for a   Successor Currency, then for purposes of calculating any amounts of 
such currency pursuant to this Transaction, and for purposes of effecting settlement 
hereof, any Original Currency amounts will be converted to the Successor Currency by 
multiplying the amount of Original Currency by a ratio of Successor Currency to Original 
Currency, which ratio will be calculated on the basis of the exchange rate set forth by 
the Republic of Chile for converting the Original Currency into the Successor Currency on 
the date on which the elimination, conversion, redenomination or exchange took place. 
If there is    more than one such date, the date closest to the relevant Payment Date will 
be selected. 
"CLP Dollar OBS Rate" in respect of any Valuation Date shall mean Chilean Peso/U.S. 
Dollar "observado" rate, expressed as the amount of Chilean Pesos per one U.S. Dollar, 
for settlement in one Business Day reported by the Banco Central de Chile 
(www.bcentral.cl) as the "Dólar Observado" (Dollar Observado) rate by not later than 
10:30 a.m., Santiago time, on the first Business Day following that Valuation Date. 
"Maximum Days of Postponement" means Fourteen (14) calendar days. 

9/11Deal No: 68021223, Deal Alias: 
CE3H26185002, ID: 
1004716215(1-2)
"Unscheduled Holiday" shall mean, for the purpose of this Transaction, that a day is    not a

by reference to other publicly available information) until a   time later than 9:00 a.m. local time 
in Santiago, two Business Days prior to the Valuation Date. 
"Valuation Postponement" means, for purposes of obtaining a   Settlement Rate, that the Spot 
Rate will be determined on the Business Day first succeeding the day on which the Price Source 
Disruption ceases to exist, unless the Price Source Disruption continues to exist (measured from 
the date, that, but for the occurrence of the Price Source Disruption, would have been the 
Valuation Date) for a   consecutive number of calendar days equal to the Maximum Days of 
Postponement. In such event, the Spot Rate will be determined on the next Business Day after 
the Maximum Days of Postponement in accordance with the next applicable Disruption 
Fallback. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the total number of 
consecutive calendar days during which either (i) valuation is    deferred due to an Unscheduled 
Holiday, or (ii) a   Valuation Postponement shall occur (or any combination of (i) and (ii)), exceed 
14 consecutive calendar days in the aggregate. Accordingly, (x) if, upon the lapse of any such 14 
day period, an Unscheduled Holiday shall have occurred or be continuing on the day following 
such period, then such day shall be deemed to be a   Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse of 
any such 14 day period, a Price Source Disruption shall have occurred or be continuing on the 
day following such period, then Valuation Postponement shall not apply and the Settlement 
Rate shall be determined in accordance with the next Disruption Fallback.
