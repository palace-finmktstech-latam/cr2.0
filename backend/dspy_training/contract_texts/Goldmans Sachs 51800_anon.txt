Event Currency:Reference Currency
Price Source Disruption :Applicable
4 Disruption Events and Fallbacks applicable to the particular Transaction to which this Confirmation relates
are as follows:
Valuation Postponement
Calculation Agent Determination of Settlement Rate
Definitions:
Unscheduled Holiday:"Unscheduled  Holiday"  shall  mean,  for  the  purpose  of  this
Transaction, that a day is not a Business Day and the market was
not aware of such fact (by means of a public announcement or by
reference to other publicly available information) until a time later
than 9:00 am local time in the Principal Financial Center(s) of the
Reference  Currency  two  Business  Days  prior  to  the  Scheduled
Valuation Date; where the definition of Business Day in Article
1.1(b)  of  the  1998  FX  Definitions  is  expanded  to  include  the
definition of UF Observation Date.
Deferral Period for Unscheduled
Holiday:
In  the  event  the  Scheduled  Valuation  Date  becomes  subject  to
the  Following  Business  Day  Convention  after  the  occurrence
of  an  Unscheduled  Holiday,  and  if  the  Valuation  Date  has
not  occurred  on  or  before  the  14th  consecutive  day  after  the
Scheduled  Valuation  Date  (any  such  period  being  a  "Deferral
Period"), then the next day after the Deferral Period that would
have been a Business Day but for the Unscheduled Holiday, shall
be deemed to be the Valuation Date.
Valuation Postponement for Price
Source Disruption:
"Valuation  Postponement"  means,  for  purposes  of  obtaining  a
Settlement  Rate,  that  the  Spot  Rate  will  be  determined  on  the
Business Day first succeeding the day on which the Price Source
DocuSign Envelope ID: BE460B8F-56F0-4D54-87A8-67F29062EB61

DocControlId: XDCTRL000000182400-0Transaction ID:SDBB7MT33364LDXNP4.0.0.0.1-0
4 of 6
Disruption  ceases  to  exist,  unless  the  Price  Source  Disruption
continues  to  exist  (measured  from  the  date  that,  but  for  the
occurrence  of  the  Price  Source  Disruption,  would  have  been
the  Valuation  Date)  for  a  consecutive  number  of  calendar  days
equal to the Maximum Days of Postponement. In such event, the
Spot Rate will be determined on the next Business Day after the
Maximum  Days  of  Postponement  in  accordance  with  the  next
applicable Disruption Fallback.
Cumulative Events:Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no
event shall the total number of consecutive calendar days during
which  either  (i)  the  valuation  is  deferred  due  to  the  occurrence
of  an  Unscheduled  Holiday,  or  (ii)  a  Valuation  Postponement
shall occur, or any combination of (i) or (ii) above has occurred,
shall  exceed  14  (fourteen)  consecutive  calendar  days  in  total.
Accordingly,  if  upon  the  lapse  of  any  such  14  (fourteen)  day
period,  an  Unscheduled  Holiday  shall  have  occurred  or  be
continuing  on  that  day  that  follows  such  period,  then  such  day
shall be deemed to be a Valuation Date and, if upon the lapse of
any such 14 (fourteen) day period, a Price Source Disruption has
occurred or is continuing on the day that follows such period, then
the  Valuation  Postponement  shall  not  apply  and  the  Spot  Rate
shall  thereby  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  Disruption
Fallback that is next deemed applicable to this Transaction.
Maximum Days of Postponement:"Maximum Days of Postponement" shall mean, for purposes of
this Transaction, fourteen (14) calendar days
Business Day Convention:
Applicable to the Scheduled
Valuation Date:
Preceding; provided, however, that the adjustment shall be made
in  accordance  with  the  Following  Business  Day  Convention  in
the event of an Unscheduled Holiday.
Adjustment to Payment Dates,
Exchange Date and Termination
Date:
If  the  Valuation  Date  in  respect  of  a  Reference  Currency
Payment  Date,  a  Reference  Currency  Exchange  Date  or  the
Termination Date is not the Scheduled Valuation Date in respect
of such Reference Currency Payment Date, Reference Currency
Exchange   Date   or   Termination   Date,   then   such   Reference
Currency Payment Date, Reference Currency Exchange Date or
Termination Date (as applicable) shall be as soon as practicable
after  the  relevant  Valuation  Date,  but  in  no  event  later  than  the
day which is two Business Days after the relevant Valuation Date.
Further, if payments are scheduled to be made by both parties on a
Payment Date, Exchange Date or Termination Date, and such date
is adjusted due to the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday in
accordance with the previous sentence, then such Payment Date,
Exchange Date or Termination Date shall be adjusted in respect
of both parties’ payments.
For the avoidance of doubt, such adjustments shall not apply in
respect of Period End Dates (including the Termination Date) for
the purposes of determining the Calculation Periods.
