Rate will be determined on the Business Day first succeeding the day on which the Price Source 
Disruption ceases to exist, unless the Price Source Disruption continues to exist (measured from 
the date, that, but for  the  occurrence  of the Price Source Disruption, would have been the 
Valuation Date) for  a    consecutive number of  calendar days  equal  to the Maximum Days of 
Postponement. In such event, the Spot Rate will be determined on the next Business Day after 
the Maximum Days of  Postponement in accordance with the next  applicable Disruption 
Fallback. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,  in no event  shall the  total  number  of 
consecutive calendar days  during  which  either (i) valuation is deferred due  to an Unscheduled 
Holiday, or (ii) a   Valuation Postponement shall occur (or any combination of (i) and (ii)), exceed 
14 consecutive calendar days in the aggregate. Accordingly, (x) if, upon the lapse of any such 14 
day period, an Unscheduled Holiday shall have occurred or be continuing  on the day  following 
such period, then such day shall be deemed to be a   Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse of 
any such 14 day period,  a   Price Source Disruption  shall have occurred or be continuing on the

Valuation Postponement shall occur (or any combination of (i) and (ii)), exceed 14 consecutive calendar 
days in the aggregate. Accordingly, (x) if, upon the lapse of any such 14 day period, an Unscheduled
