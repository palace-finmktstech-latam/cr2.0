be determined on the Business Day first succeeding

have  been  the  Valuation  Date)  for  a  consecutive
number of calendar days equal to the Maximum Days

be  determined  on  the  next  Business  Days  after  the

calendar  days  during  which  either  (i)  the  Final

Accordingly,  (x)  if,  upon  the  lapse  of  any  such
14  day  period,  an  Unscheduled  Holiday  shall  have
occurred or be continuing on the day following such
period, then such day shall be deemed to be the Final
Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse of any such
14 day period, a Price Source Disruption shall have
occurred or be continuing on the day following such

and  such  date  is  adjusted  due  to  the  occurrence
of   an   Unscheduled   Holiday   or   the   application
of   Valuation   Postponement,   then   such   Payment
Date  shall  be  adjusted  in  respect  of  both  parties’
payment  obligations.  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,
