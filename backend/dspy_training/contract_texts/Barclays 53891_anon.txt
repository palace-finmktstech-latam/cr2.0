Convention.
As used herein, "Unscheduled Holiday" shall mean,
in respect of the Scheduled Valuation Date, that a day
is not a Business Day and the market was not aware
of such fact (by means of a public announcement or
by reference to other publicly available information)
until  a  time  later  than  9:00  a.m.  local  time  in
the  Principal  Financial  Centre(s)  of  the  Reference

*BC/TRI/11539447/05/27*
Unscheduled Holiday following the Trade Date, then
New York only
Other Terms:
Valuation Postponement for Price Source Disruption:“Valuation  Postponement”  means,  for  purposes  of
obtaining a Settlement Rate, that the Spot Rate will
be determined on the Business Day first succeeding
the day on which the Price Source Disruption ceases
to exist, unless the Price Source Disruption continues
to  exist  (measured  from  the  date  that,  but  for  the
occurrence  of  the  Price  Source  Disruption,  would
have  been  the  Valuation  Date)  for  a  consecutive
number of calendar days equal to the Maximum Days
of  Postponement.  In  such  event,  the  Spot  Rate  will
be  determined  on  the  next  Business  Days  after  the
Maximum Days of Postponement in accordance with
the next applicable Disruption Fallback.
Cumulative Events:Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the  contrary,
in  no  event  shall  the  total  number  of  consecutive
calendar  days  during  which  either  (i)  the  Final
Valuation  Date  is  deferred  due  to  an  Unscheduled
Holiday  or  (ii)  the  Final  Valuation  Postponement
shall  occur  (or  any  combination  of  (i)  and  (ii)),
exceed 14 consecutive calendar days in the aggregate.
Accordingly,  (x)  if,  upon  the  lapse  of  any  such
14  day  period,  an  Unscheduled  Holiday  shall  have
occurred or be continuing on the day following such
period, then such day shall be deemed to be the Final
Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse of any such
14 day period, a Price Source Disruption shall have
occurred or be continuing on the day following such
period, then Valuation Postponement shall not apply
and the Spot Rate shall be determined in accordance
with the next Disruption Fallback.
Maximum Days of Postponement:
Fourteen (14) calendar days
Adjustment to Payment Dates and Exchange Dates:Each  Payment  Date  for  the  Swap  Transaction  shall
be  as  specified  above.  If  payments  are  scheduled
to  be  made  by  both  parties  on  a  Payment  Date,
and  such  date  is  adjusted  due  to  the  occurrence
of   an   Unscheduled   Holiday   or   the   application
of   Valuation   Postponement,   then   such   Payment
Date  shall  be  adjusted  in  respect  of  both  parties’
payment  obligations.  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,
such adjustments shall not apply in respect of Period
End Dates (including the Termination Date) for the
purpose of determining the Calculation Periods.
