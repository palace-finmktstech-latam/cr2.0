reference  to  other  publicly  available  information)  until  a  time  later  than  9:00 
a.m. local time in the Principal Financial Center(s) of the Reference Currency 
two Business Days prior to the Scheduled Valuation Date. 
“Deferral Period” for Unscheduled  
Holiday: In the  event the  Scheduled  Valuation Date becomes  subject to the Following 
Business  Day  Convention  after  the  occurrence  of  an  Unscheduled  Holiday, 
and if the  Valuation Date has not occurred on or before  the  14th consecutive 
day after the Scheduled Valuation Date (any such period being a “Deferral 
Period”), then the next day after the Deferral Period that would have been a 
Business  Day  but  for  the  Unscheduled Holiday,  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the 
Valuation Date. 
Valuation Postponement 
for Price Source Disruption: “Valuation  Postponement”  means,  for  purposes  of  obtaining  a  Settlement 
Rate,  that  the  Spot  Rate  will  be  determined  on  the  Business  Day  first 
succeeding the  day  on  which  the  Price  Source  Disruption  ceases  to  exist, 
unless the Price Source Disruption continues to exist (measured from the date 
that,  but  for  the  occurrence  of  the  Price  Source  Disruption,  would  have  been 
the  Valuation  Date)  for  a  consecutive  number  of  calendar  days  equal  to  the 
Maximum  Days  of  Postponement.  In  such  event,  the  Spot  Rate  will  be 
determined   on   the   next   Business   Day   after   the   Maximum   Days   of 
Postponement   in accordance with the next applicable Disruption Fallback. 
Cumulative Events: Except  as  provided  below,  in  no  event  shall  the  total  number  of  consecutive 
calendar   days   during   which   either   (i)   valuation   is   deferred   due   to   an 
Unscheduled  Holiday,  or  (ii)  a  Valuation  Postponement  shall  occur  (or  any 
combination  of  (i)  and  (ii)),  exceed  14  consecutive  calendar  days  in  the 
aggregate.  Accordingly,  (x)  if,  upon  the  lapse  of  any  such  14  calendar  day 
period,  an  Unscheduled  Holiday  shall  have  occurred  or  be  continuing  on  the 
day  following  such  period  that  otherwise  would  have  been  a  Business  Day, 
then  such  day  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  Valuation  Date,  and  (y)  if,  upon  the 
lapse of any such 14 calendar day period, a Price Source Disruption shall have 
occurred or be continuing on the day following such period on which the Spot 
Rate  otherwise  would  be  determined,  then  Valuation  Postponement  shall  not 
apply  and  the  Spot  Rate  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  next 
Disruption Fallback.  
Maximum Days of Postponement: Fourteen (14) calendar days 
Adjustment to Termination Date,  
Payment Dates and  
Exchange Dates: If  the  Valuation  Date  in  respect  of  a  Reference  Currency  Payment  Date,    a 
Reference  Currency  Exchange  Date  or  the  Termination  Date  is  not  the 
Scheduled  Valuation  Date  in  respect  of  such  Reference  Currency  Payment 

 
 
GMRT-MXMA51154390-CONF-NEW-51226114-12052023 -7-  
 
 
Date,  Reference  Currency  Exchange  Date  or  Termination  Date,  then  such 
Reference  Currency  Payment  Date,  a  Reference  Currency  Exchange  Date  or 
Termination  Date  (as  applicable)  shall  be  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the 
relevant  Valuation  Date,  but  in  no  event  later  than  the  day  which  is  two 
Business  Days  after  the  relevant  Valuation  Date.    Further,  if  payments  are 
scheduled  to  be  made  by  both  parties  on  a  Payment  Date,  Exchange  Date  or 
Termination  Date,  and  such  date  is  adjusted  due  to  the  occurrence  of  an 
Unscheduled Holiday  in  accordance  with  the  previous  sentence,  then  such 
Payment  Date,  Exchange  Date  or  Termination  Date  shall  be  adjusted  in 
respect of both parties’ payments.  
 For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  such  adjustments  shall  not  apply  in  respect  of 
Period  End  Dates  (including  the  Termination  Date)  for  the  purposes  of 
determining the Calculation Periods.
